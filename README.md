## 📖 Overview

Bengaluru is known as the Silicon Valley of India, but it is also one of the most expensive cities to live in. This project analyzes a dataset of various expense categories—including rent, transport, food, and utilities—to determine the minimum and average budget required for students and working professionals.

**Key Objectives:**
* Analyze the distribution of expenses across different neighborhoods.
* Visualize the correlation between lifestyle choices and monthly budget.
* Provide a clear breakdown of "Needs" vs. "Wants" for financial planning.

* **Rohith R.** (Documentation & Analysis)

## 📊 Key Features & Analysis

* **Correlation Analysis:** Generated Heatmaps (Correlation Matrices) to identify how rent prices influence overall monthly expenditure.
* **Expense Distribution:** Pie charts and Bar graphs visualizing the percentage of income spent on Transport (Metro/Bus) vs. Food/Rent.
* **Budget Calculator:** A logic-based model to estimate monthly costs based on user inputs (e.g., "Student" vs. "Professional").
* **Data Cleaning:** Pre-processing scripts using Pandas to handle missing values and outliers in the price data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **IDE:** VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

    ```

## 📈 Visualizations

> *Note: Below is a summary of the insights generated by our code.*

* **Rent vs. Location:** A scatter plot showing the variance in rent across Tier-1 and Tier-2 areas.
* **Transport Costs:** Analysis of Metro vs. Private vehicle daily commute expenses (e.g., Average ₹66/day for Metro).
* **Correlation Matrix:** A heatmap highlighting the strong relationship between "Dining Out" frequency and "Total Monthly Savings".
